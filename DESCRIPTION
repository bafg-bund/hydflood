Description: hydflood extends the functionalities of hyd1d, an R package to 
    interpolate 1D water level and gauging data, to raster based GIS processing. 
    hydflood adopts strategies originally developed for INFORM, an 
    ArcGIS-based hydro-ecological modelling framework, to compute flood extent 
    and duration. It does not provide a full, physical hydraulic modelling 
    algorythm, but a simplified, near realtime GIS approach for flood 
    extent and duration modelling.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0), sp, raster, rgeos, hyd1d, hoardr
