Description: The functionalities of hyd1d, an R package to interpolate 1D water
    level and gauging data, are extended to raster based GIS processing by
    hydflood. The package adopts strategies originally developed for INFORM, an 
    ArcGIS-based hydro-ecological modelling framework, to compute flood extent 
    and duration. It does not provide a full, physical hydraulic modelling 
    algorithm, but a simplified, near real time GIS approach for flood 
    extent and duration modelling.
