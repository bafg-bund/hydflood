Description: Raster based flood modelling internally using 'hyd1d', an R package
    to interpolate 1d water level and gauging data. The package computes flood
    extent and durations through strategies originally developed for 'INFORM',
    an 'ArcGIS'-based hydro-ecological modelling framework. It does not provide
    a full, physical hydraulic modelling algorithm, but a simplified, near real
    time 'GIS' approach for flood extent and duration modelling. Computationally
    demanding annual flood durations have been computed already and data
    products were published by Weber (2022) <doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.948042>.
